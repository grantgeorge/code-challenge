# Set The Code Challenge

## Introduction

> This code challenge is designed to asses real-world internet application development capability

Through completing the challenge we will be able to measure your:

- Programming capability
- Communication Skills
- Resourcefulness

## Description

We're creating an application that allows users to create "short messages",
have a message feed, the capability to favorite other user's "short messages",
and the ability to follow other users. It's very similar to some other, popular
"short message" app out there 😉

You will be building a frontend client application that consumes an existing
API interface. See the specification section below for more details of what
the application should do.

The API is available here: [api-example][] 🚀

Documentation for the api can be found here: [api-source][] 📚

An example application can be found here: [client-example][]

And it's codez are available here: [client-source][] (react/redux)

#### You do not need to download and use this API but are welcome to do so. Feel free to use the remote API listed above

## Application Specification

> In priority order. For example, complete "Posts" before moving on to "Profiles"

#### Users

- Create a new user
- Login
- View profile
- Edit profile

#### Authentication

- Authentication with [jwt][] 🔐

#### Posts (or "short messages 😉")

- Show a "feed" of posts from users you follow
- Show a global "feed" of all recent posts
- Create a new post
- A "details" view that shows post and it's comments
- Update a post
- Delete a post

#### Favoriting

- Be able to favorite a post
- Be able to unfavorite a post
- Show total # of favorites
- Indicate if user has favorited post

#### Commenting

- View post comments under "details" view
- Create a new post comment
- Delete a post comment

#### Profiles

- View a user's profile information
- Follow a user
- Unfollow a user
- Show user follow count

#### Testing

- If time permits, add tests!!

## How is it assessed?

> This is kinda™ in priority order

- Code quality
- Creativity
- Completeness
- Readability
- Performance
- Testing
- General organization
- Design and look/feel
- Fun! 🎉

## General tips

- Do not spend more than 2 - 4 hours on this!
- Use any framework you'd like or none at all!
- Feel free to use any boilerplate, online guides, etc. The internet is your resource!
- Feel free to ask me questions, or schedule a time to pair program (remote or in-person) a particular problem you're stuck on (up to 1 hour) <grant@settheset.com>!
- Have fun!! 😄
- Program/frontend skillz have the highest weight so I recommend using a popular design framework such as [bootstrap][], [material-ui][], etc.

## Submission

Please provide the following:

- An email letting me know you've finished!
- A link to the app deployed on the interwebs, an uploaded video walking through the UI, or runnable codez
- A link to the source code
- Schedule a time for a live code walk-through where I'll ask questions
